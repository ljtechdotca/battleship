# Battleship

Battleship is a project @Kanawanagasaki, and I built together. He made the WebSocket server using C#. While I built its front-end side using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[Please check out Kanawanagasaki's GitHub! His server handles the players, rooms, and backend game logic and is the real star here.](https://github.com/Kanawanagasaki/BattleshipWebsocketServer)
